# terminal-in-canvas

There are several projects that allows you to use the JavaScript canvas in the terminal but, have you ever wanted or needed to use a terminal in a HTML page (through canvas)?

No? I don't care, because this project allows you to have access to a low-level interface to modify directly a buffer to render characters like in a old style terminal.
