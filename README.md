# terminal-in-canvas

There are several projects that allows you to use the JavaScript canvas in the terminal but... have you ever needed (or just wanted) to use a terminal in a HTML page (through canvas)?

No? Really, not even once? Well, I don't care.

And thanks to my lack of empathy this project allows you to have access to a low-level interface to modify directly a buffer to render characters like the a old style terminals.
